This post is the fifth post in a series about writing a small application in
Rust to display information about a particular git repository.

- [Part 1: Writing MVP][part-01]
- [Part 2: Logging][part-02]
- [Part 3: Testing the UI and color schemes][part-03]
- [Part 4: Type driven development in Rust][part-04]

In this part I tell the story of integrating it into my ZSH setup and the
additional improvements I had to do.
