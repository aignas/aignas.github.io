title: Website for a curtain seamstress
project: siulelis-lt

[siulelis.lt](http://siulelis.lt) is a website
for an acquaintance of mine and is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
and themes from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).

I am hosting it on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) in an S3 bucket and
routing to it via Route53 DNS service.
I used [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) for having a nice email with the
custom domain for free.
I also used [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) in order to have a form
at the bottom of the page.
And design was created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/).

I may write a blog post on how it is set up someday...
