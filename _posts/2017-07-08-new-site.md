Well.
I have finally got around to rewriting my old website to sit on top of 
[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [github](https://github.com) 
integration.
I need to admit though, that the theme I am using for this website was
shamelessly stolen from [minddust](http://minddust.com), which I found by
searching for something that would support tags and categories with th
vanilla github/jekyll setup.
I hope to create my own theme soon, but for the time being I think
it is one of the most aesthetically pleasing themes I have found so far.
